# micro-graphql-react

A light (2.6K min+gzip) and simple solution for painlessly connecting your React components to a GraphQL endpoint.

Wrapped components maintain a basic client-side cache of your query history. The cache is LRU with a default size of 10, and stored at the level of the specific query, not the GraphQL type. As your instances mount and unmount, and update, the cache will be checked for existing results to matching queries, and will be used if found. This project is intended to be small and simple, and, unlike other GraphQL libraries, allow you to cache at the Service Worker level, discussed below.

Queries are fetched via HTTP GET, so while the client-side caching is not nearly as robust as Apollo's, you can set up a Service Worker to cache results there; Google's Workbox, or sw-toolbox make this easy.

**A note on cache invalidation**

This library will not automatically add metadata requests to your query, and attempt to update your cached results. The reason, quite simply, is because this is a hard problem, and no existing library handles it completely. Rather than try to solve this, you're given some simple primitives which will allow you to specify how given mutations should affect cached results. It's slightly more work, but it allows you to tailer your solution to your app's precise needs, and, given the predictable, standard nature of GraphQL results, composes well. Of course you can just turn client-side caching off, and run a network request each time, which, if you have a Service Worker set up, may not be too bad at all. This is all explained at length, below.

## Queries

```javascript
import { Client, query, compress, mutation, setDefaultClient } from "micro-graphql-react";

const client = new Client({
  endpoint: "/graphql",
  fetchOptions: { credentials: "include" }
});

setDefaultClient(client);

@query(
  `query ALL_BOOKS ($page: Int) {
    allBooks(PAGE: $page, PAGE_SIZE: 3) {
      Books { _id title }
    }
  }`,
  props => ({ page: props.page })
)
class BasicQuery extends Component {
  render() {
    let { loading, loaded, data } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        {loading ? <div>LOADING</div> : null}
        {loaded ? <div>LOADED</div> : null}
        {data ? <ul>{data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

The `query` decorator is passed the GraphQL query, and an optional function mapping the component's props to a variables object. When the component first mounts, this query will be executed. When the component updates, the variables function will re-run with the new props, and the query will re-fetch **if** the newly-created GraphQL query is different. Of course if your query has no variables, it'll never update.

Be sure to use the `compress` tag to remove un-needed whitespace from your query, since it will be sent via HTTP GETâ€”just wrap any inline string parameters you may have in `${}` - for more information, see [here](./readme-compress.md).

### props passed to your component

- `loading` Fetch is executing for your query
- `loaded` Fetch has finished executing for your query
- `data` If the last fetch finished successfully, this will contain the data returned, else null
- `error` If the last fetch did not finish successfully, this will contain the errors that were returned, else null
- `reload` A function you can call to manually re-fetch the current query
- `clearCache` Clear the cache for this component
- `clearCacheAndReload` Calls `clearCache`, followed by `reload`

### Other options

The decorator can also take a third argument of options (or second argument, if your query doesn't use variables). The following properties can be passed in this object:

- `onMutation` - a map of mutations, along with handlers. This is how you update your cached results after mutations, and is explained more fully below
- `mapProps` - allows you to adjust the props passed to your component. If specified, a single object with all your GraphQL props will be passed to this function, and the result will be spread into your component's props
- `cacheSize` - override the default cache size of 10. Pass in 0 to disable caching completely
- `shouldQueryUpdate` - take control over whether your query re-runs, rather than having it re-run whenever the produced graphql query changes. This function is passed a single object with the properties listed below. If specified, your query will only re-run when it returns true, though you can always manually re-load your query with the reload prop, discussed above.

  - prevProps - previous component props
  - props - current component props
  - prevVariables - previous graphql variables produced
  - variables - current graphql variables produced

- `client` - manually pass in a client to be used for this component

An example of `mapProps` and `cacheSize`

```javascript
@query(
  `query ALL_BOOKS($title_contains: String) {
      allBooks(title_contains: $title_contains, SORT: {title: 1}, PAGE_SIZE: 1, PAGE: 1) {
        Books { _id title }
      }
    }`,
  props => ({ title_contains: props.title_contains }),
  { mapProps: props => ({ firstBookProps: props }), cacheSize: 3 }
)
@query(
  `query ALL_BOOKS($title_contains: String) {
    allBooks(title_contains: $title_contains, SORT: {title: -1}, PAGE_SIZE: 1, PAGE: 1) {
      Books { _id title }
    }
  }`,
  props => ({ title_contains: props.title_contains }),
  { mapProps: props => ({ lastBookProps: props }), cacheSize: 3 }
)
class TwoQueries extends Component {
  render() {
    let { firstBookProps, lastBookProps } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        {firstBookProps.loading || lastBookProps.loading ? <div>LOADING</div> : null}
        {firstBookProps.loaded || lastBookProps.loaded ? <div>LOADED</div> : null}
        {firstBookProps.data ? <ul>{firstBookProps.data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}
        {lastBookProps.data ? <ul>{lastBookProps.data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Mutations

```javascript
@mutation(`mutation modifyBook($title: String) {
    updateBook(_id: "591a83af2361e40c542f12ab", Updates: { title: $title }) {
      Book { _id title }
    }
  }`)
class BasicMutation extends Component {
  render() {
    let { running, finished, runMutation } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        {running ? <div>RUNNING</div> : null}
        {finished ? <div>SAVED</div> : null}

        <input ref={el => (this.el = el)} placeholder="New title here!" />
        <button onClick={() => runMutation({ title: this.el.value })}>Save</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Same idea as `query`, pass a string for your mutation and you'll get a `runMutation` function in your props that you can call, and pass your variables.

### props passed to your component

- `running` Mutation is executing
- `finished` Mutation has finished executing
- `runMutation` A function you can call when you want to run your mutation. Pass it an object with your variables

### Other options

Like `query`, you can pass a second argument to your `mutation` decorator. Here, this object only supports the `mapProps`, and `client` options, which work the same as for queries.

```javascript
@query(
  `
    query ALL_BOOKS($page: Int) {
      allBooks(PAGE: $page, PAGE_SIZE: 3) {
        Books { _id title pages }
      }
    }`,
  props => ({ page: props.page })
)
@mutation(
  `mutation modifyBook($_id: String, $title: String) {
    updateBook(_id: $_id, Updates: { title: $title }) { success }
  }`,
  { mapProps: props => ({ titleMutation: props }) }
)
@mutation(
  `mutation modifyBook($_id: String, $pages: Int) {
    updateBook(_id: $_id, Updates: { pages: $pages }) { success }
  }`,
  { mapProps: props => ({ pagesMutation: props }) }
)
class TwoMutationsAndQuery extends Component {
  state = { editingId: "", editingOriginaltitle: "" };
  edit = book => {
    this.setState({ editingId: book._id, editingOriginaltitle: book.title, editingOriginalpages: book.pages });
  };
  render() {
    let { loading, loaded, data, titleMutation, pagesMutation } = this.props;

    let { editingId, editingOriginaltitle, editingOriginalpages } = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        {loading ? <div>LOADING</div> : null}
        {loaded ? <div>LOADED</div> : null}
        {data ? (
          <ul>
            {data.allBooks.Books.map(book => (
              <li key={book._id}>
                {book.title}
                <button onClick={() => this.edit(book)}> edit</button>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        ) : null}

        {editingId ? (
          <Fragment>
            {titleMutation.running ? <div>RUNNING</div> : null}
            {titleMutation.finished ? <div>SAVED</div> : null}
            <input defaultValue={editingOriginaltitle} ref={el => (this.el = el)} placeholder="New title here!" />
            <button onClick={() => titleMutation.runMutation({ _id: editingId, title: this.el.value })}>Save</button>

            {pagesMutation.running ? <div>RUNNING</div> : null}
            {pagesMutation.finished ? <div>SAVED</div> : null}
            <input defaultValue={editingOriginalpages} ref={el => (this.elPages = el)} placeholder="New pages here!" />
            <button onClick={() => pagesMutation.runMutation({ _id: editingId, pages: +this.elPages.value })}>Save</button>
          </Fragment>
        ) : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Cache invalidation

The onMutation option that `query` takes is an object, or array of objects, of the form `{ when: string|regularExpression, run: function }`

`when` is a string or regular expression that's tested against each result set of any mutations that finish. If the mutation has any matches, then `run` will be called with three arguments: the mutations variables object, the entire mutation result, and an object with these propertes: `{ softReset, currentResults, hardReset, cache, refresh }`

`softReset` - clears the cache, but does **not** re-issue any queries. It can optionally take an argument of new, updated results, which will replace the current `data` props
`currentResults` - the current results that are passed as your `data` prop
`hardReset` - clear the cache, and re-load the current query from the network
`cache` - the actual cache object. You can enumerate its entries, and update whatever you need.
`refresh` - refresh the current query from cache. You'll likely want to call this after modifying the cache.

Many use cases follow. They'll all be based on an hypothetical book tracking website since, if we're honest, the Todo example has been stretched to its limitâ€”and also I built a book tracking website and so already have some data to work with :D

The code below was tested on an actual GraphQL endpoint created by my [mongo-graphql-starter project](https://github.com/arackaf/mongo-graphql-starter)

### Use Case 1: Hard reset and reload after any mutation

Let's say that whenever a mutation happens, we want to immediately invalidate any related queries' caches, and reload the current queries from the network, in order to see the latest results. We understand that this may cause a book that we just edited to immediately disappear from our current search results, since it no longer matches our search criteria, but that's what we want.

The hard reload method that's passed makes this easy. Let's see how to use this in a (contrived) component that queries, and displays some books.

```javascript
@query(BOOKS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), {
  onMutation: { when: /(update|create|delete)Books?/, run: (args, resp, { hardReset }) => hardReset() }
})
export class BookQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}
```

Here we specify a regex matching every kind of book mutation we have, and upon completion, we just clear the cache, and reload by calling `hardReset()`. It's hard not to be at least a littler dissatisfied with this solution; the boilerplate is non-trivial. Let's take a look at a similar (again contrived) component, but for the subjects we can apply to books

```javascript
@query(SUBJECTS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), {
  onMutation: { when: /(update|create|delete)Subjects?/, run: (args, resp, { hardReset }) => hardReset() }
})
export class SubjectQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allSubjects.Subjects.map(subject => <li key={subject._id}>{subject.name}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}
```

Assuming our GraphQL operations have a consistent naming structureâ€”and they shouldâ€”then some pretty obvious patterns emerge. We can auto-generate this structure just from the name of our type, like so

```javascript
const hardResetStrategy = name => ({
  when: new RegExp(`(update|create|delete)${name}s?`),
  run: (args, resp, { hardReset }) => hardReset()
});
```

and then apply it like so

```javascript
@query(BOOKS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), { onMutation: hardResetStrategy("Book") })
export class BookQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}

@query(SUBJECTS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), { onMutation: hardResetStrategy("Subject") })
export class SubjectQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allSubjects.Subjects.map(subject => <li key={subject._id}>{subject.name}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}
```

### Use Case 2: Update current results, but otherwise clear the cache

Let's say that, upon successful mutation, you want to update your current results based on what was changed, clear all other cache entries, including the existing one, but **not** run any network requests. So if you're currently searching for an author of "Dumas Malone", and one of the current results was written by Shelby Foote, and you click the edit button and fix it, you want that book to now show the updated values, but stay in the current results, since re-loading the current query and having the book just vanish is bad UX in your opinion.

Here's the same books component as above, but with our new cache strategy

```javascript
@query(BOOKS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), {
  onMutation: {
    when: "updateBook",
    run: (args, { updateBook: { Book } }, { softReset, currentResults }) => {
      let CachedBook = currentResults.allBooks.Books.find(b => b._id == Book._id);
      CachedBook && Object.assign(CachedBook, Book);
      softReset(currentResults);
    }
  }
})
export class BookQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}
```

The interesting work is being done on line 2 above, in `onMutation`. Whenever a mutation comes back with `updateBook` results, we use `softReset` to update our current results, while clearing our cache, including the current cache result; so if you page up, then come back down to where you were, a **new** network request will be run, and your edited book will no longer be there, as expected. Note that in this example we're actually mutating our current result; that's fine.

This seems like a lot of boilerplate, but again, lets look at the subjects component and see if any patterns emerge.

```javascript
@query(SUBJECTS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), {
  onMutation: {
    when: "updateSubject",
    run: (args, { updateSubject: { Subject } }, { softReset, currentResults }) => {
      let CachedSubject = currentResults.allSubjects.Subjects.find(s => s._id == Subject._id);
      CachedSubject && Object.assign(CachedSubject, Subject);
      softReset(currentResults);
    }
  }
})
export class SubjectQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allSubjects.Subjects.map(subject => <li key={subject._id}>{subject.name}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}
```

As before, since we've named our GraphQL operations consistently, there's some pretty obvious repetition. Let's again refactor this into a helper method that can be re-used throughout our app.

```javascript
const standardUpdateSingleStrategy = name => ({
  when: `update${name}`,
  run: ({ [`update${name}`]: { [name]: updatedItem } }, { softReset, currentResults }) => {
    let CachedItem = currentResults[`all${name}s`][`${name}s`].find(x => x._id == updatedItem._id);
    CachedItem && Object.assign(CachedItem, updatedItem);
    softReset(currentResults);
  }
});
```

Now we can clean up all that boilerplate from before

```javascript
@query(BOOKS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), { onMutation: standardUpdateSingleStrategy("Book") })
export class BookQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}

@query(SUBJECTS_QUERY, props => ({ page: props.page }), { onMutation: standardUpdateSingleStrategy("Subject") })
export class SubjectQueryComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    let { data } = this.props;
    return <div>{data ? <ul>{data.allSubjects.Subjects.map(subject => <li key={subject._id}>{subject.name}</li>)}</ul> : null}</div>;
  }
}
```

And if you have multiple mutations, just pass them in an array

### Use Case 3: Manually update all affected cache entries

TODO: (code is written and works, docs will be updated soon)

## Manually running queries or mutations

It's entirely possible some pieces of data may need to be loaded from, and stored in your state manager, rather than fetched via a component's lifecycle; this is easily accomodated. The component decorators run their queries and mutations through the client object you're already setting via `setDefaultClient`. You can call those methods yourself, in your state manager (or anywhere).

### Client api

- `runQuery(query: String, variables?: Object)`
- `runMutation(mutation: String, variables?: Object)`

For example, to imperatively run the query from above in application code, you can do

```javascript
client.runQuery(
  `query ALL_BOOKS ($page: Int) {
    allBooks(PAGE: $page, PAGE_SIZE: 3) {
      Books { _id title }
    }
  }`,
  { title: 1 }
);
```

and to run the mutation from above, you can do

```javascript
client.runMutation(
  `mutation modifyBook($title: String) {
    updateBook(_id: "591a83af2361e40c542f12ab", Updates: { title: $title }) {
      Book { _id title }
    }
  }`,
  { title: "New title" }
);
```

## Transpiling decorators

Be sure to use the `babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy` Babel plugin. The code is not _yet_ updated to work with the new decorators proposal.

### But I don't like decorators

That's fine! This will work too

```javascript
class BasicQueryNoDecorators extends Component {
  render() {
    let { loading, loaded, data } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        {loading ? <div>LOADING</div> : null}
        {loaded ? <div>LOADED</div> : null}
        {data ? <ul>{data.allBooks.Books.map(book => <li key={book._id}>{book.title}</li>)}</ul> : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
const BasicQueryConnected = query(
  `
    query ALL_BOOKS($page: Int) {
      allBooks(PAGE: $page, PAGE_SIZE: 3) {
        Books {
          _id
          title
        }
      }
    }`,
  props => ({ page: props.page })
)(BasicQueryNoDecorators);
```

I plan on supporting both the old, and new class decorator formats indefinitely, if for no other reason than to transparently allow for separate, explicit wrapping like the above. This pattern is popular for unit testing React components.

But really, don't be afraid to give decorators a try: they're awesome!

## Use in old browsers

By default this library ships standard ES6, which should work in all modern browsers. If you have to support older, non-ES6 browsers like IE, then just add the following alias to your webpack's resolve section

```javascript
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "micro-graphql-react": "node_modules/micro-graphql-react/index-es5.js"
    },
    modules: [path.resolve("./"), path.resolve("./node_modules")]
  }
```

## What's next

- Add a render prop API
